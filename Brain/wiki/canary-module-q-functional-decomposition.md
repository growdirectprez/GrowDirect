# Module Q (Loss Prevention) — Functional Decomposition

> **Artifact layer.** Third of three Canary module artifact layers:
> 1. **Canonical spec** (vendor-neutral) — `Canary-Retail-Brain/modules/Q-loss-prevention.md`
> 2. **Code/schema crosswalk** (Canary-specific) — `Brain/wiki/canary-module-q-loss-prevention.md` *(planned for Q/T/R; exists for J/P/F/C)*
> 3. **Functional decomposition** (Counterpoint-substrate-aware, L2/L3 + user stories) — *this card*

## Governing thesis

Q is the only spine module that is **★ Canary native in every Counterpoint Solution Map**, because Counterpoint exposes the substrate (audit logs, drawer sessions, void-comp reasons, pricing decisions, category margin targets) but no detection layer. Q's functional surface is dominated by **detection rule execution** — 23 rules across 10 families — wrapped by five cross-cutting concerns (substrate ingestion, detection lifecycle, tuning, investigator surface, deployment phasing) and one vertical concern (garden-center allow-list framework).

The decomposition is observer-shaped end to end. Cashiers ring sales; Q watches the Documents arrive. Every L3 has actors drawn from `Chirp` (the rule engine), `Owl` (analyst-facing natural-language surface), `Fox` (case management), and the human store GM / LP analyst who consumes what those agents surface. There are no L3 processes whose actor is "the cashier" — that decomposition lives in Counterpoint's UI, not in Canary.

## Executive summary

| Dimension | Count | Source |
|---|---|---|
| L2 process areas | 7 | This card |
| L3 functional processes | 38 | This card |
| Detection rules referenced | 23 | `canary-module-q-counterpoint-rule-catalog.md` |
| Detection rule families (L3 grouping) | 10 | Rule catalog |
| Garden-center allow-lists (first-class) | 5 | Rule catalog + garden-center-operating-reality |
| Assumptions requiring real-customer validation | 12 | Tagged `ASSUMPTION-Q-NN` |
| User stories enumerated | 71 | Observer-perspective; actor ∈ {Chirp, Owl, Fox, Store GM, LP Analyst, Operator} |

**Posture:** archetype-shaped. No real customer engaged. Every assumption marker exists because the answer requires either a Rapid Garden POS sandbox database, a real customer's data, or both. The card is reusable across Counterpoint-shaped customers; per-customer overrides slot into the final section.

## Q.1 — Substrate ingestion

**Purpose.** Q reads CRDM only. T/R/N/S/F/D adapters populate CRDM from Counterpoint. Q never reaches into Counterpoint directly. This L2 enumerates which CRDM entities Q depends on, what fields it needs, and what cross-module contracts it asserts.

**Dependency posture.** Q is a **read-only consumer** of every other in-scope module. Any field Q needs must be exposed by the upstream module's adapter; Q does not write back into substrate.

**A.3.1 dependency (load-bearing):** Q.2 detection rules depend on A.3.1 asset-item registry as allow-list input. Items classified as non-inventory assets (ITEM_TYP = N or fixture class) must be excluded from Q detection rule evaluation. Q.2 must consume A.3.1 before firing inventory-discrepancy rules.

**N.5 upstream contract:** Q.1.4 store-config threshold context is sourced from N.5 (store-demographic config + LP threshold publication). N.5 must hold for Q.1.4 baseline expectations to be accurate. Changes to N.4 thresholds require Q rule re-evaluation.

### L3 processes

| ID | L3 process | Substrate read | Owning upstream module | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Q.1.1 | Read transaction headers | `Events.transactions` ← `PS_DOC_HDR` | T | DOC_ID, STR_ID, STA_ID, DRW_ID, DRW_SESSION_ID, USR_ID, SLS_REP, CUST_NO, TKT_NO, RS_UTC_DT, IS_DOC_COMMITTED, IS_REL_TKT |
| Q.1.2 | Read transaction lines | `Events.transaction_lines` ← `PS_DOC_LIN[]` | T | LIN_TYP, ITEM_NO, QTY_SOLD, PRC, REG_PRC, EXT_COST, EXT_PRC, MIX_MATCH_COD, IS_DISCNTBL, HAS_PRC_OVRD |
| Q.1.3 | Read payments | `Events.payments` ← `PS_DOC_PMT[]` | F (with T) | PAY_COD, PAY_COD_TYP, AMT, CARD_IS_NEW, SWIPED, EDC_AUTH_FLG |
| Q.1.4 | Read multi-authority taxes | `Events.transaction_taxes` ← `PS_DOC_TAX[]` | F | AUTH_COD, RUL_COD, TAX_AMT, TXBL_LIN_AMT |
| Q.1.5 | Read audit log | `Events.audit_log_entries` ← `PS_DOC_AUDIT_LOG[]` | T | LOG_SEQ_NO, CURR_USR_ID, CURR_DT, CURR_STA_ID, CURR_DRW_ID, ACTIV, LOG_ENTRY |
| Q.1.6 | Read pricing decisions | `Events.pricing_decisions` ← `PS_DOC_LIN_PRICE[]` | T (with P-derived) | PRC_JUST_STR, PRC_GRP_TYP, PRC_RUL_SEQ_NO, UNIT_PRC, QTY_PRCD |
| Q.1.7 | Read original-doc references | `Events.original_doc_refs` ← `PS_DOC_HDR_ORIG_DOC[]` | T | Links return → original sale, void → original sale |
| Q.1.8 | Read store config thresholds | `Places.stores` ← `PS_STR_CFG_PS` | N | MAX_DISC_AMT, MAX_DISC_PCT, USE_VOID_COMP_REAS, RETAIN_CR_CARD_NO_HIST, ALLOW_DRW_REACTIV |
| Q.1.9 | Read item categories with margin targets | `Things.item_categories` ← `IM_CATEG_COD` | S | CATEG_COD, MIN_PFT_PCT, TRGT_PFT_PCT |
| Q.1.10 | Read customer tier + AR posture | `People.customers` ← `AR_CUST` | R | CUST_NO, CATEG_COD (tier), CR_RATE, NO_CR_LIM, BAL, IS_TAX_EXEMPT |
| Q.1.11 | Read transfers, receivers, RTVs | `Events.transfers / receivers / returns_to_vendor` ← Document with DOC_TYP=XFER/RECVR/RTV | D, J | Source/dest store, vendor, items, quantities, payment if any |

### User stories

- *As Chirp, I want every CRDM field listed in Q.1.x to be present and typed before any rule fires, so that no rule silently misses data due to upstream adapter gaps.*
- *As Chirp, I want substrate-staleness signals (`last_polled_at` per entity per tenant) so I can suppress alerts when the substrate is older than my freshness budget.*
- *As an LP Analyst in Owl, I want to ask "what data is Q seeing for this store today" and get a freshness + completeness scorecard, not just rule output.*

### Cross-module contracts asserted

- T must surface `PS_DOC_AUDIT_LOG` flattened with `ACTIV` and `LOG_ENTRY` preserved verbatim — Q rules pattern-match on these strings (**ASSUMPTION-Q-01**: full ACTIV code list)
- T must surface `PS_DOC_HDR_ORIG_DOC` even when empty — Q.2.2 distinguishes "no link" from "no array"
- N must surface `PS_STR_CFG_PS` thresholds at tenant-config time, not per-transaction (cached daily)
- S must surface category margin targets (`MIN_PFT_PCT`, `TRGT_PFT_PCT`) on every item join

## Q.2 — Detection rule execution

**Purpose.** Run the rule catalog. Each rule has substrate, logic, parameters, allow-lists, and severity. This L2 organizes the 23 rules into 10 families; the detailed rule definitions live in the rule catalog companion.

**MECE assertion.** Every detection in Canary against a Counterpoint substrate routes to exactly one rule family. New detection categories require a new family, not stuffing into an existing one.

### L3 processes (rule families)

| ID | Family | Rule IDs | What it detects | Garden-center wrinkle |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Q.2.1 | Discount-and-markdown | Q-DM-01, Q-DM-02, Q-DM-03 | Price-override abuse, markdown-then-buy, below-cost sales | Wholesale tier customers may legitimately exceed store MAX_DISC_PCT — allow-list per CATEG_COD |
| Q.2.2 | Void-and-return | Q-VR-01, Q-VR-02, Q-VR-03 | Voids without original ticket, refunds without lookup, employee void clusters | None vertical-specific; rules apply uniformly |
| Q.2.3 | Tender-mix anomalies | Q-TM-01, Q-TM-02, Q-TM-03 | Cash-only register patterns, tender swaps, payment fragmentation | Farmers-market / event days legitimately cash-skewed — temporal allow-list |
| Q.2.4 | Drawer-and-session | Q-DS-01, Q-DS-02, Q-DS-03 | Drawer-count shrinkage, post-close activity, drawer reactivation | None vertical-specific |
| Q.2.5 | Audit-trail anomalies | Q-AT-01, Q-AT-02, Q-AT-03 | Document edits after payment, cross-station handling, manager-override frequency | Layaway / order-pickup workflows naturally cross-station — allow-list legitimate hold-and-recall flows |
| Q.2.6 | Margin-erosion | Q-ME-01, Q-ME-02 | Below-category-target margin sales, free-item patterns | Mix-and-match groups have intentionally low line margin (bundle margin is positive) — bundle-aware aggregation |
| Q.2.7 | Inventory-and-shrink | Q-IS-01, Q-IS-02, Q-IS-03, Q-IS-04 | Receiver-vs-PO discrepancy, **cash-paid receivers (informational)**, transfer loss, **dead-count tracking (informational)** | **First-class garden-center awareness:** Q-IS-02 is allow-list-as-rule (cash receivers are normal). Q-IS-04 is informational tracking against seasonal baseline, not fraud |
| Q.2.8 | Tax-and-compliance | Q-TC-01, Q-TC-02 | Multi-authority tax mismatches, tax-exempt customer abuse | Landscaper customers may carry resale exemption; pattern-detect retail use of exemption |
| Q.2.9 | Customer-tier abuse | Q-CT-01, Q-CT-02 | Wholesale tier on retail-pattern customer, pre-purchase tier upgrade | Garden-center customer tiers are particularly volatile (seasonal landscaper conversions) — wider time window for Q-CT-02 |
| Q.2.10 | Mix-and-match abuse (garden-center-specific) | Q-MM-01, Q-MM-02 | Mix-and-match producing below-cost line, mix-match code on non-grouped item | Entire family is garden-center-originated; will need re-shaping for non-garden verticals |

### User stories per family

#### Q.2.1 Discount-and-markdown

- *As Chirp, I want to flag any line where `HAS_PRC_OVRD = "Y"` and per-line discount exceeds the store's `MAX_DISC_AMT/PCT` threshold, with the customer's tier (`AR_CUST.CATEG_COD`) joined so wholesale-tier overrides are auto-suppressed.*
- *As Chirp, I want to detect markdown-then-buy patterns by joining `Things.items` price-change events to subsequent transactions involving the same `ITEM_NO` and same `USR_ID/SLS_REP` within 24h.*
- *As an LP Analyst in Owl, I want to ask "show me all below-cost sales by employee this month" and get a ranked list with each row drillable to the originating Document audit log.*

#### Q.2.2 Void-and-return

- *As Chirp, I want to flag any voided transaction whose `Events.original_doc_refs` is empty, distinguishing "no link present" (suspicious) from "training-mode transaction" (allow-listed).*
- *As Chirp, I want to flag refund transactions where no receipt-lookup audit-log entry preceded the refund — refund without ticket lookup is the high-confidence cash-refund-fraud signal.*
- *As Fox, I want same-employee void clusters within a single drawer session bundled into a single case rather than fired as N separate detections.*

#### Q.2.3 Tender-mix anomalies

- *As Chirp, I want to compare the cash-share at each `(STA_ID, DRW_SESSION_ID)` to that station's rolling baseline and flag sessions that deviate beyond threshold.*
- *As Chirp, I want to detect tender-swap patterns by replaying audit-log entries on a Document and flagging cases where original tender = card and a later edit changed it to cash.*
- *As an LP Analyst, I want a Friday-and-Saturday allow-list for stations designated as "event tents" so farmers-market-day cash patterns don't fire weekly false positives.*

#### Q.2.4 Drawer-and-session

- *As Chirp, I want every drawer-close event to compare reconciled cash count to expected and emit a Q-DS-01 detection if the gap exceeds `(dollar_threshold OR pct_threshold)`.*
- *As Chirp, I want any audit-log entry on a Document committed AFTER its drawer-close timestamp to fire Q-DS-02, with a configurable grace window.*
- *As Fox, I want recurring per-employee shrinkage across multiple sessions auto-promoted from low-severity individual detections to a single high-severity case.*

#### Q.2.5 Audit-trail anomalies

- *As Chirp, I want to flag any line modification on a Document where `IS_DOC_COMMITTED = "Y"` was set before the modification timestamp — committed Documents shouldn't be edited.*
- *As Chirp, I want to flag any single Document whose audit log shows `CURR_STA_ID` changing across 3+ stations, with layaway/order-pickup workflows allow-listed.*
- *As an LP Analyst, I want manager-override frequency reported as a trend not as alerts — it's a pattern signal, not a per-event signal.*

#### Q.2.6 Margin-erosion

- *As Chirp, I want every transaction line to compute `(EXT_PRC - EXT_COST) / EXT_PRC` and compare against the line's category `MIN_PFT_PCT`, aggregating below-target-margin volume per employee per week.*
- *As Chirp, I want any line with `EXT_PRC = 0` and `HAS_PRC_OVRD = "Y"` to count toward Q-ME-02 free-item-pattern detection per `(USR_ID, DRW_SESSION_ID)`.*
- *As Owl, I want to answer "which categories are running below margin target this month and why" with the per-line breakdown drillable to the contributing Documents.*

#### Q.2.7 Inventory-and-shrink

- *As Chirp, I want to flag any receiver Document whose total quantity differs from the originating PO by > 5% or > $100, allow-listing documented short-shipments.*
- *As Chirp, I want **cash-paid receiver classification (Q-IS-02) routed to an "ad-hoc-vendor-payment" review queue, NOT the fraud queue** — this is the load-bearing garden-center allow-list.*
- *As Chirp, I want every transfer Document compared source-quantity vs destination-received-quantity, aggregating shrinkage to a per-route trend.*
- *As a Garden-Center GM in Owl, I want dead-count write-offs tracked against seasonal baseline (per category, per season) so spikes surface but normal seasonal shrink doesn't.*

#### Q.2.8 Tax-and-compliance

- *As Chirp, I want every Document's tax stack compared to the store's expected jurisdiction stack and flag any mismatches (could indicate misconfiguration or tax-evasion).*
- *As Chirp, I want tax-exempt-customer transactions pattern-matched against retail-walk-in shape (single-line, low-dollar, retail SKUs) and flag suspected exemption abuse.*
- *As an LP Analyst, I want a per-customer history view showing tax-exempt usage across 90 days so a known landscaper's legitimate exempt purchases are obvious.*

#### Q.2.9 Customer-tier abuse

- *As Chirp, I want any customer whose `CATEG_COD = WHOLESALE/LANDSCAPER` but transaction history matches retail (avg ticket < $X, single-line walk-in) flagged for tier review.*
- *As Chirp, I want any tier change on a customer record within 72h of a large purchase flagged as Q-CT-02, distinguishing legitimate sales-rep promotions from same-day-upgrade-then-buy patterns.*
- *As Owl, I want to answer "which wholesale-tier customers actually shop like wholesale customers" and get the segmentation with explicit thresholds.*

#### Q.2.10 Mix-and-match abuse (garden-center-specific)

- *As Chirp, I want bundle-level margin computed for any transaction containing `MIX_MATCH_COD` lines — flag only when the BUNDLE margin is negative, not when individual line margins are.*
- *As Chirp, I want to flag any line carrying a `MIX_MATCH_COD` whose corresponding `IM_ITEM` is not part of that mix-match group — manual override pattern.*
- *As Fox, I want mix-and-match abuse cases tagged with the bundle definition snapshot at detection time so retroactive bundle changes don't invalidate the case.*

### Cross-cutting rule contracts

- Every rule has a `dry_run | observation | alerting` mode (per Q.7 phasing)
- Every rule produces a `Detection` row carrying the substrate snapshot, not just IDs (so retroactive substrate changes don't invalidate detections)
- Every rule has explicit allow-list hooks at the parameter layer (per Q.4)
- Every rule emits to Fox case-bundling per `(employee, session, time-window)` co-occurrence rules

## Q.3 — Detection lifecycle

**Purpose.** A detection isn't a one-shot fire-and-forget. Every Q.2 rule output flows through the same lifecycle stages: emit → suppress → bundle → escalate → case → close. This L2 owns the lifecycle.

### L3 processes

| ID | L3 process | Triggers | Output | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Q.3.1 | Detection emission | Rule fires against substrate | `Detection` row | Carries substrate snapshot, not just FK references |
| Q.3.2 | Suppression evaluation | New detection arrives | suppress / pass-through | Allow-list match → suppressed-with-reason; threshold-below → suppressed-as-noise |
| Q.3.3 | Case bundling | Multiple detections within `(employee, session, time-window)` | `Case` row groups N detections | Fox owns the bundling policy |
| Q.3.4 | Severity escalation | Bundled case crosses severity threshold | severity bumped (low → medium → high) | E.g., 3+ low-sev shrinkage detections in 7d → medium case |
| Q.3.5 | Investigator notification | Case reaches alerting threshold | Slack / email / dashboard alert | Per-tenant notification config |
| Q.3.6 | Case investigation | Investigator opens case in Fox | Case state machine: open → in-progress → resolved/dismissed | Investigator notes, evidence attachment, audit trail |
| Q.3.7 | Case close + outcome capture | Investigator marks resolved | Outcome enum: confirmed-fraud / training-issue / false-positive / unactionable | Outcomes feed back into rule tuning |

### User stories

- *As Chirp, I want every detection emission to write the substrate snapshot inline so a parser change tomorrow doesn't retroactively invalidate yesterday's detection.*
- *As Fox, I want the bundling policy to be configurable per tenant (some merchants want per-employee-per-day, others per-employee-per-session).*
- *As an LP Analyst, I want every dismissed false-positive to feed into a per-rule false-positive-rate metric so rule tuning is grounded in real outcomes, not vibes.*
- *As a Store GM, I want one daily case digest instead of N individual alerts — Fox's bundling is the difference between Q being useful and Q being noise.*
- *As Owl, I want to answer "which cases are still open across our stores" with the case state machine queryable.*

## Q.4 — Tuning & allow-list management

**Purpose.** Every rule is tunable by parameter; every rule has an allow-list. This L2 owns the operator-facing controls and the audit discipline around them.

### L3 processes

| ID | L3 process | Surface | Audit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q.4.1 | Threshold tuning per rule | `tune_rule_threshold(rule_id, parameter, value)` MCP tool | Audit-logged with operator + before/after + reason |
| Q.4.2 | Allow-list entry creation | `add_allow_list_entry(rule_id, scope, reason)` MCP tool | Audit-logged; entries carry expiration |
| Q.4.3 | Allow-list expiration / sunset | Automatic expiration job + manual revocation | Expired entries logged; renewal requires fresh reason |
| Q.4.4 | Vertical-pack application | Apply garden-center pack at tenant onboarding (Q.6) | Snapshot at apply time; per-customer overrides tracked |
| Q.4.5 | Rule promotion (dry-run → alerting) | `promote_rule(rule_id, mode)` MCP tool | Audit-logged with operator + readiness check |

### User stories

- *As an Operator in Owl, I want to tune `Q-DM-01.severity_threshold` from 1.0 to 1.5 with one MCP call and see the new value reflected in the next rule evaluation.*
- *As an Operator, I want to add an allow-list entry for "customer 12345 — wholesale exemption granted by GM, expires 2027-04-25" with one call, with the expiration enforced automatically.*
- *As an LP Analyst, I want to see the audit log of every threshold change and allow-list entry across the last 90 days, so audit-time reviews are clean.*
- *As Fox, I want every detection to carry the threshold-as-of-detection-time so retroactive threshold tuning doesn't invalidate past detections.*

## Q.5 — Investigator & analyst surface

**Purpose.** Q outputs are meant to be consumed. This L2 owns the surfaces — Owl natural-language queries, Fox case management, MCP tools for programmatic access.

### L3 processes

| ID | L3 process | Surface | Actor |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q.5.1 | Detection query | `query_detections(rule_id?, date_range, store_id?)` MCP tool | LP Analyst, Operator |
| Q.5.2 | Detection detail | `get_detection_detail(detection_id)` — full substrate snapshot + audit trail | LP Analyst |
| Q.5.3 | Owl natural-language Q&A over detections | Owl prompt → SQL/MCP synthesis → answer | Store GM, Exec |
| Q.5.4 | Fox case workflow | Case open/in-progress/resolved/dismissed state machine | LP Analyst, Investigator |
| Q.5.5 | Dry-run preview | `dry_run_rule(rule_id, date_range)` MCP tool — execute rule without writing detections | Operator (during tuning) |
| Q.5.6 | Per-store / per-employee dashboards | Pre-built tiles surfacing Q outputs | Store GM, LP Analyst |
| Q.5.7 | Case digest (daily/weekly) | Scheduled digest of open cases per recipient | Store GM, Exec |

### User stories

- *As a Store GM in Owl, I want to ask "what should I be paying attention to today?" and get the top 3 open Q cases for my store, ranked by severity and drillable to investigation context.*
- *As an LP Analyst in Fox, I want to open a case, see all bundled detections + substrate snapshots + audit trails on one screen, attach my notes, and resolve with an outcome — without ever running a SQL query.*
- *As an Operator, I want to dry-run a tuned rule against the last 30 days of data and see how many detections it would have produced, before I promote it to alerting.*
- *As an Exec, I want a weekly digest with: cases opened, cases closed, confirmed-fraud-rate, top 3 patterns by frequency. One scrollable email.*
- *As Owl, I want to answer "did our LP improve this month vs last" with a per-store comparison drawn from the case state machine.*

## Q.6 — Vertical configuration

**Purpose.** Q is the most vertical-aware module. Garden-center allow-lists are first-class, not bolt-on. This L2 owns the vertical-pack framework: what's in the garden-center pack today, how new vertical packs get added.

### L3 processes (the 5 garden-center allow-lists)

| ID | Allow-list | Rules affected | Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q.6.1 | Cash-vendor-payment (load-bearing) | Q-IS-02 (cash-paid receivers) | Classify as ad-hoc-vendor-payment, route to review queue, NOT fraud queue |
| Q.6.2 | Manual-entry noise | Q-IS-01, Q-IS-03 (receiver / transfer discrepancies) | Wider tolerance bands for receiver/transfer reconciliation |
| Q.6.3 | Item-code drift | Q-ME-01, Q-CT-01 (margin / tier-on-retail) | Items churning in/out of catalog mid-season treated as expected |
| Q.6.4 | Live-goods write-off | Q-IS-04 (dead-count tracking) | Seasonal baseline per category; only spikes above baseline flag |
| Q.6.5 | Mix-and-match expected overlap | Q-MM-01 (mix-match below-cost line) | Bundle-margin computed; flag only when BUNDLE goes negative |

### L3 processes (vertical-pack management)

| ID | L3 process | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Q.6.6 | Apply vertical pack at tenant onboarding | Garden-center pack applied to any tenant flagged `vertical=garden-center` |
| Q.6.7 | Override vertical pack per-tenant | Customer-specific tightening or relaxation, audit-logged |
| Q.6.8 | Author new vertical pack | When second vertical (gun store, feed-and-tack, specialty food, wine) onboards |

### User stories

- *As an Operator onboarding a new garden-center tenant in Owl, I want to apply the garden-center vertical pack with one call and see all 5 allow-lists become active, with per-tenant override available.*
- *As an Operator, I want to see exactly which Q rules a vertical pack tunes and exactly what each tuning does, before I apply it.*
- *As a Garden-Center GM, I want cash-paid receivers from my specialty growers to land in a "review and confirm" queue, not in the same alert stream as suspected fraud — Canary should know specialty growers paid in cash are normal.*
- *As an LP Analyst at a non-garden-center customer, I want a clear UI signal that "this rule has a garden-center allow-list bypass that does NOT apply to this tenant" so I'm not confused about why a rule's behavior differs across tenants.*

## Q.7 — Deployment phasing

**Purpose.** Rules don't all fire on day-zero of a customer deployment. This L2 owns the per-tenant rollout discipline: backfill → observation → tuning → steady state. The phases come from the existing rule catalog; this card formalizes them as L3 processes.

### L3 processes (per-tenant cutover phases)

| ID | Phase | Window | Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q.7.1 | Day 0 — backfill + dry-run | Tenant install + initial 24-72h Document backfill | All rules in dry-run mode; historical analysis only; no detections written; produces sample case packs for tuning |
| Q.7.2 | Day 1-7 — observation | First operational week post-cutover | Low-FPR rules promoted to informational alerts; high-FPR rules stay dry-run; investigator pre-tuning baseline established |
| Q.7.3 | Day 8-30 — tuning | Operator reviews dry-run outputs, tunes thresholds + allow-lists | Rules promoted per-rule based on dry-run outcome quality; vertical pack applied + customer-specific overrides set |
| Q.7.4 | Day 30+ — steady state | All planned rules in alerting | Continuous tuning per investigator-feedback loop; quarterly rule-catalog audit |

### L3 processes (deployment ops)

| ID | L3 process | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Q.7.5 | Tenant cutover playbook | Runbook for taking a tenant from Q.7.1 → Q.7.4 |
| Q.7.6 | Per-tenant rollback | If a rule fires badly, demote back to dry-run without blocking other rules |
| Q.7.7 | Rule-catalog version pinning per tenant | Tenants can stay on rule catalog v1.x while v2.x deploys to new tenants — controlled migration |

### User stories

- *As an Operator cutting over a new garden-center tenant, I want a runbook that takes me through Q.7.1 → Q.7.4 with explicit go/no-go gates, not a vague "tune as needed" instruction.*
- *As an Operator, I want to demote any individual rule from alerting back to dry-run with one MCP call when a tuning miss surfaces in production, without affecting other rules' state.*
- *As Canary's Product Owner, I want every customer's rule-catalog version pinned and visible, so a v2.x rollout doesn't silently change behavior for v1.x tenants.*
- *As an LP Analyst, I want the Day-30 tuning review to be backed by data — every rule promoted-or-demoted with explicit dry-run evidence, not gut feel.*

## Assumptions requiring real-customer validation

These markers exist because the answer requires either a Rapid Garden POS sandbox database, a real Counterpoint customer's data, or both. Until resolved, the corresponding rule logic is best-effort against public-source archetype information.

| ID | Assumption | What it blocks | Resolution path |
|---|---|---|---|
| ASSUMPTION-Q-01 | Counterpoint audit-log `ACTIV` codes — what each code means | Q.2.5 rules pattern-match on `LOG_ENTRY` strings; ACTIV is the intended discriminator | Sandbox DB inspection or NCR doc deep-read |
| ASSUMPTION-Q-02 | Drawer reconciliation event modeling — captured in `PS_DOC_AUDIT_LOG`, separate `KeyValueData`, or different endpoint | Q.2.4 (Q-DS-01 drawer-shrinkage) substrate path | Sandbox DB inspection |
| ASSUMPTION-Q-03 | Manager-override flag representation — explicit `USR_ID` role marker, or inferred from override-having + `Roles` membership | Q-DM-01 (discount-cap-exceeded confirmation), Q-AT-03 (manager-override frequency) | Sandbox DB or live customer Roles config |
| ASSUMPTION-Q-04 | Tax-exempt customer field name — likely `AR_CUST.IS_TAX_EXEMPT`, not directly visible in current sample | Q-TC-02 (tax-exempt abuse) substrate path | Sandbox DB schema inspection |
| ASSUMPTION-Q-05 | Dead-count / write-off Document type code — RTV with reason code, separate adjustment workflow, or other | Q-IS-04 (dead-count tracking) entire substrate path | **Real garden-center customer data** — this is the highest-leverage gap |
| ASSUMPTION-Q-06 | Document edit-after-commit — does Counterpoint allow this, or do edits require void+reissue | Q-AT-01 (edit-after-payment) — if void+reissue, rule needs reframing | Sandbox DB workflow test |
| ASSUMPTION-Q-07 | Multi-name plant convention — which fields hold botanical / Spanish / common names | Q.1.x substrate ingestion completeness for L&G item identity | Real Rapid Garden POS customer DB |
| ASSUMPTION-Q-08 | Rapid POS proprietary tables on top of standard Counterpoint schema | Whether Q rules need additional substrate joins | Direct conversation with Rapid POS / customer |
| ASSUMPTION-Q-09 | Real customer's category margin targets (defaults from API, but every customer tunes) | Q-ME-01 thresholds | Tenant onboarding — first 30 days observation |
| ASSUMPTION-Q-10 | Real customer's tier code conventions (`CATEG_COD` values vary per VAR / customer) | Q-CT-01 (wholesale-on-retail-pattern), Q.6 vertical pack tier-aware allow-lists | Tenant onboarding |
| ASSUMPTION-Q-11 | Day-0 backfill data volume and cleanliness — historical Documents may have schema drift, missing audit logs, etc. | Q.7.1 (backfill + dry-run) feasibility for tenants with long history | Customer-specific scoping at onboarding |
| ASSUMPTION-Q-12 | Mix-and-match grouping conventions per Rapid Garden POS — whether bundles are stored as `MIX_MATCH_COD` groups or via Rapid-proprietary extensions | Q.2.10 (mix-and-match abuse) entire substrate path | Real garden-center customer DB |

**Highest-leverage gaps:** ASSUMPTION-Q-05 (dead-count workflow) and ASSUMPTION-Q-12 (mix-and-match implementation) — both are garden-center-distinctive and both require a real customer database. These should be priority asks of any first Rapid Garden POS customer engagement.

## Customer-specific overrides

*Empty until a real customer engagement starts. Format reserved:*

## Operating notes

- This card is the **L2/L3 functional decomposition for one module**. Sister cards (T, R, N, S, F, D) are next; format must remain consistent across them so the Solution Map cells can cross-reference cleanly.
- The methodology gap this card stands in is real: CATz Phase II has no named artifact at this layer. Once 2-3 module cards are stable, propose `CATz/method/artifacts/module-functional-decomposition.md` formally with this Q card as the worked-example proof.
- Every L3 process here either has a corresponding rule in `canary-module-q-counterpoint-rule-catalog.md` (for Q.2 detection), an MCP tool surface (for Q.4–Q.5), or a runbook (for Q.7). Nothing is purely speculative — but every L3 has assumption markers where the substrate-side answer requires real-customer ground-truthing.
