# Canary Service: receiving

## What this is

Owns purchase-order lifecycle and receiving events including direct-store-delivery (DSD) without prior PO, plus vendor master data. Cross-references canary-commercial for vendor-invoice reconciliation; cross-references canary-inventory for receipt-driven position increments.

## Tier mix and axis

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Port | `:8092` |
| Axis | B — Resource APIs |
| Tier mix | Reference (PO/receipt/vendor lookups) · Change-feed (filtered lists) · Stream (lifecycle mutations) · Bulk window (EDI 810, PO bulk imports) |
| Owned tables | `app.purchase_orders`, `app.po_lines`, `app.receipts`, `app.receipt_lines`, `app.receipt_variances`, `app.vendors` |
| PO state machine | `DRAFT → SUBMITTED → IN_TRANSIT → RECEIVED → RECONCILED → CLOSED` (with CANCELED branches) |
| Receipt idempotency | `(vendor_id, vendor_invoice_number, location_id)` natural key |

## Purpose

Receipt-side authoritative. Invoice-side reconciliation explicitly delegated to canary-commercial — RECONCILED transition is set by canary-commercial when invoice match completes. EDI 810 bulk import supports vendor-systems-of-record sync.

## Dependencies

- canary-identity, canary-item
- canary-inventory (receipt → position increment)
- canary-commercial (RECONCILED transition, invoice match)

## Consumers

- canary-inventory (position increment events)
- canary-commercial (PO + receipt linkage for reconciliation)
- canary-ildwac (receiving events trigger cost-model recompute)
