# Canary Service: ecom-channel

## What this is

Adapter for ecommerce channels — Square Online (V1), Shopify and WooCommerce (V2+). Treats ecom orders as transactions on a parallel channel — same ARTS POSLog normalization, separate channel attribution.

## Tier mix and axis

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Port | `:9080` |
| Axis | A — Adapter Substrate · B — Resource APIs |
| Tier mix | Stream (webhook receivers, OAuth, connection mutations, reservations) · Change-feed (sync ops) · Reference (status reads) · Bulk window (historical order backfill) |
| Owned tables | `app.ecom_connections`, `app.ecom_oauth_state`, `app.ecom_sync_watermarks`, `app.ecom_reservations` |

## Purpose

Channel-to-ARTS mapping with explicit attribution (`transaction_metadata.channel`). Inventory reservation flow: cart-add → reserve stock with 15-min TTL → commit on checkout / release on abandonment. Omnichannel-attribution case ("did this customer buy in-store after browsing online") handled in canary-owl.

## Dependencies

- canary-identity, canary-tsp (transaction landing)
- canary-inventory-as-a-service (reservation engine)
- External ecom platforms (Square Online, Shopify, WooCommerce)

## Consumers

- canary-tsp (normalized transactions)
- canary-inventory-as-a-service (reservation events)
- canary-owl (omnichannel attribution joins)
