# Canary Service: employee

## What this is

Employee master records, role assignments, position bindings, and schedule references. The canonical record for who works for the merchant; roster data used by canary-fox (case subjects), canary-owl (EJ Spine attribution), and canary-chirp (employee-scoped detection rules).

## Tier mix and axis

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Port | `:8095` |
| Axis | B — Resource APIs |
| Tier mix | Reference (lookups, role catalog) · Change-feed (filtered list) · Stream (master CRUD, role changes) · Bulk window (HRIS roster import) |
| Owned tables | `app.employees`, `app.employee_roles`, `app.employee_locations`, `app.roles` |
| State machine | `ACTIVE → INACTIVE → TERMINATED` (TERMINATED triggers EJ Spine archival) |

## Purpose

Master record. Does **not** execute payroll or time-and-attendance — those are downstream merchant systems. Employee-Journey Spine querying is canary-owl's concern; this service owns the master record only. PII handling: email/phone require `employee:read-pii` JWT scope.

## Dependencies

- canary-identity (JWT, merchant scope)
- canary-owl (publishes employee status changes for EJ Spine)
- canary-fox (subject lookup on case open)

## Consumers

- canary-fox (case subjects)
- canary-owl (EJ Spine attribution)
- canary-chirp (employee-scoped detection rules)
- canary-store-brain (operator-presence lookup)
