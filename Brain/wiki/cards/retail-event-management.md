## What this is

The retail event management model: how promotional events are planned, funded, executed, and evaluated — including the co-op allowance framework that ties vendor funding to retailer promotional commitments.

## Purpose

Promotional events are the primary demand acceleration lever in retail. A well-managed promotional calendar drives traffic, clears seasonal inventory, and captures vendor co-op dollars that offset markdown costs. Poorly managed promotions generate demand spikes that replenishment isn't ready for, co-op funds that expire unclaimed, and margin erosion that isn't offset by the anticipated volume. Event management exists to make promotions profitable, predictable, and measurable.

## Structure

**Event types:**

| Event type | Characteristics |
|-----------|----------------|
| Weekly ad | Recurring circular promotion, items pre-committed weeks in advance |
| Seasonal event | Holiday or seasonal peak, requiring early inventory build |
| Clearance event | Planned markdown to liquidate slow-moving or end-of-life inventory |
| Vendor-funded event | Co-op or MDF (Marketing Development Funds) funded promotion |
| In-store event | Physical event (demo, class, sampling) with associated inventory and staffing |
| Competitive response | Unplanned markdown response to competitor pricing action |

**Event planning process:**

1. **Activity calendar** — A promotional calendar is established for the planning period (quarter, season, year). It specifies which weeks have ad events, which events are vendor-funded vs. retailer-funded, and which categories are featured each week.

2. **Item and price selection** — Specific items are assigned to each event. Promotional price is set at the event level. Pre-event inventory checks confirm sufficient supply to support the event — promoting an item that will stock out two days in damages the brand and the vendor relationship.

3. **Vendor commitment** — For vendor-funded events, the co-op or promotional allowance is confirmed with the vendor before the event is committed to print or broadcast. Allowance amounts, usage rules (brand standards, approval requirements), and claim timing are governed by the vendor's co-op terms in the compliance standards.

4. **Purchase order creation** — Event-driven inventory build requirements feed the replenishment process. Promotional POs are created with the event date as the delivery-by constraint. Promotional demand is flagged so forecasting can isolate it from baseline.

5. **Execution** — Stores receive the event plan with item, price, signage, and execution instructions. End cap and feature space assignments are communicated as part of the event brief. Store management executes the plan; sell-through guidelines for discretionary end cap space are set centrally.

6. **Evaluation** — Post-event: actual sales vs. planned sales (lift measurement), promotional margin (net of allowance), sell-through rate, and stockout rate. Promotional events that consistently under-deliver vs. plan are renegotiated or discontinued. Vendor events that under-deliver on co-op terms trigger an allowance claim adjustment.

**Co-op accounting:**

- Co-op funds are accrued as marketing allowances as qualifying purchases are made.
- Co-op claims are submitted post-event with documentation (ad tear sheet, sales data, proof of placement).
- Unearned or unclaimed co-op funds are recaptured at period end — tracking the deadline and claim pipeline is a Finance function with significant bottom-line impact.
- Co-op compliance is a vendor scorecard dimension: vendors who fail to fund committed co-op events are scored and flagged.

**Coupon and loyalty integration** — Coupons are tracked separately from standard promotional pricing. Coupon transactions are archived for vendor reimbursement (where vendor-funded) and for demand analytics (to separate coupon-driven demand from baseline).

## Consumers

The Forecasting module reads the promotional event calendar to compute promotional demand components and isolate them from the baseline. The Replenishment module reads event-driven inventory build requirements to size purchase orders ahead of the event. The Finance/AP module tracks co-op accruals and submits claims. The Operations Agent monitors sell-through rates during events and alerts when an event item is heading toward stockout before the event ends. The Vendor Agent tracks co-op commitments vs. utilization by vendor.

## Invariants

- Promotional demand must be flagged in the forecasting system. Promotions that inflate the baseline forecast cause over-ordering in subsequent non-promotional weeks.
- Co-op claims must be submitted before the vendor's claim deadline. Missed deadlines forfeit earned funds — the deadline is a hard business constraint, not a soft one.
- Promotional pricing changes must be communicated to stores with sufficient lead time (defined per event type). Last-minute price changes that hit stores the same day the ad drops cause POS and customer service failures.

## Platform (2030)

**Agent mandate:** Business Agent owns promotional calendar management — event planning, item and price selection, vendor commitment tracking, and post-event evaluation. Finance Agent manages co-op accrual and claim submission. Operations Agent monitors sell-through velocity in real time during active events and alerts when stockout risk is developing before the event ends. No agent modifies promotional pricing at POS without merchant authorization.

**Event calendar as forecasting signal.** The promotional event calendar is a data source, not just a planning document. Business Agent publishes upcoming events to the forecasting model as structured data — event dates, item list, expected lift by prior event performance. The forecasting model computes the promotional demand component automatically, without manual uplift adjustments by a replenishment analyst. Promotional demand isolation is algorithmic: if the event calendar is current, the forecast is correct. If it isn't, the model has no signal and defaults to baseline — which understates demand and leads to stockouts during the event.

**Co-op claim automation.** Traditional co-op management requires Finance staff to track accrual deadlines, assemble documentation, and submit claims manually. Finance Agent automates this: when a promotional event closes, Finance Agent computes the earned co-op amount against the vendor's co-op terms, assembles the claim package (sell-through data, event documentation), and submits the claim via the vendor's co-op portal or MCP endpoint. Unclaimed co-op approaching a vendor deadline surfaces as an Operations Agent alert — a hard-dollar recovery opportunity that has historically slipped through in manual processes.

**MCP surface.** `event_calendar(period)` returns planned promotional events with item list, pricing, and vendor funding status. `event_performance(event_id)` returns actual vs. planned lift, sell-through rate, and co-op ROI. `coop_pipeline(vendor_id)` returns accrued co-op, claimed amount, pending claims, and deadline dates. `sellthrough_alert(event_id)` returns items in an active event tracking toward stockout before event end.

**RaaS.** Event performance data — sales lift, redemption counts, co-op accruals — derives from receipt events attributed to the event window at ingestion time, not retroactively. An event that ends at midnight must attribute receipts to the correct side of that boundary; retroactive attribution corrupts both event performance measurement and co-op claim accuracy. `event_performance(event_id)` must be pre-aggregated — a real-time join over all transactions × all events × attribution window is prohibitive at scale. Event records in SQL indexed on (start_date, end_date); event-receipt attribution table indexed on (event_id, transaction_date). Co-op accrual data exportable for vendor claim filing; attribution data exportable for marketing effectiveness analysis.
