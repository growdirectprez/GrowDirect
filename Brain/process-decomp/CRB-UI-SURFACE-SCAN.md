# CRB UI Surface Scan — 2026-04-28

**Governing thesis:** Before L4 activities can be specified, every L3 must be classified as either requiring a designed user surface or operating entirely as a background process. UI-surface L3s need UX decisions first; systematic L3s can be speced from API docs alone. This file is the input to the CATz Phase II To-Be Workshops — it defines the aspirational heat-map.

## Module Summary

| Module | Total L3s | UI-Surface | Systematic | Mixed | Notes |
|--------|---------|-----------|-----------|-------|-------|
| T — Transaction Pipeline | 41 | 1 | 40 | 0 | Almost entirely background pipe |
| Q — Loss Prevention | 38 | 12 | 26 | 0 | Alert delivery + investigator tools + allow-list admin |
| C — Customer | 32 | 14 | 18 | 0 | Investigator search + profile + risk surface |
| N — Device | 27 | 10 | 17 | 0 | Store config admin + device health |
| A — Asset Management | 12 | 1 | 11 | 0 | Blocked on ASSUMPTION-A-01 |
| M — Merchandising | 26 | 16 | 5 | 5 | Account management + invoicing + contract pricing |
| D — Distribution | 35 | 8 | 22 | 5 | Transfer workflow + reconciliation dashboard |
| F — Finance | 31 | 8 | 23 | 0 | Reporting + budget mgmt surface |
| O — Orders | 47 | 16 | 25 | 6 | Receiving clerk + buyer approval + OTB dashboard |
| S — Space / Range / Display | 36 | 22 | 14 | 0 | Largest UI surface in corpus |
| P — Pricing & Promotion | 33 | 14 | 19 | 0 | Promotion calendar + markdown + clearance workflows |
| L — Labor | 15 | 7 | 8 | 0 | Scheduling + time entry + payroll export |
| E — Execution | 14 | 6 | 8 | 0 | Cross-domain case management + remediation |
| **TOTAL** | **357** | **135** | **200** | **22** | **38% require UI; 56% systematic; 6% mixed** |

**What "Mixed" means:** the L3 has both a background computation step and a user-facing output or input step (e.g., forecasting engine + forecast review dashboard). The L4 split within the L3 will separate them.

## Systematic L3 Summary

These processes have no user-facing surface requirement. L4 activities can be derived directly from API documentation and schema specs. No UX design required before implementation.

| Module | Systematic L3 IDs | Count | Primary Source for L4 |
|--------|------------------|-------|----------------------|
| T | T.1.1–T.6.5 (all except T.7 contracts) | 40 | Counterpoint `/Documents` endpoint + PS_DOC schema |
| Q | Q.1.1–Q.2.10, Q.3.1–Q.4.5 | 26 | Q rule catalog + Chirp detection engine logic |
| R | C.1.1–C.1.5, C.5.1–C.5.4 | 18 | Counterpoint `/Customers` + privacy model |

## Mixed L3s — Require Both Systematic Spec and UI Design

These L3s have a background computation step AND a user-facing output. The L4 split within each L3 will separate the systematic activities (spec from docs) from the UI activities (requires design).

| Module | L3 ID | Process | Systematic Piece | UI Piece |
|--------|-------|---------|-----------------|---------|
| J | O.1.1–O.1.7 | Demand forecasting | Statistical calculation | Forecast review surface (O.1.7) |
| J | O.3.1–O.3.3 | OTB calculation | Budget vs actual calc | OTB balance display |
| J | O.4.1–O.4.2 | Suggested order generation | Order quantity calc | Suggested order review list |
| J | O.4.4–O.4.5 | PO write-back + status | POST to Counterpoint | PO status display |
| D | D.3.2–D.3.4 | Transfer in-transit tracking | Sync from Counterpoint | In-transit status display |
| D | D.4.2–D.4.3 | Loss reconciliation calc | Variance calculation | Variance review screen |
| C | M.5.1–M.5.4 | B2B reporting | Metric aggregation | Report display surface |
| P | P.3.3–P.3.5 | Markdown monitoring | Price change detection | Markdown effectiveness display |
| L | L.3.2–L.3.3 | Productivity scoring | Score calculation | Score display on investigator surface |

## CATz To-Be Workshop Input

This scan maps directly to the CATz Phase II workstream structure:

| CATz Artifact | Feeds From This Scan | Output |
|---|---|---|
| To-Be Workshop decks (one per domain) | Surface Type 3 (workflows) + Surface Type 4 (config) | Per-domain user journey maps |
| Aspirational heat-map | All Surface Type tags | Full-coverage UI vs systematic grid |
| Development effort estimate | UI-surface count (135) vs systematic (200) | Design days + build-test days split |
| IT Architecture Options — per-option slide skeleton | Systematic L3 count → determines backend build scope | Backend architecture spec |
| RFP Package attachments | UI-surface L3s by module | Vendor capability coverage requirements |

**Immediate next step (CATz Phase II, Workstream 1):** Run one To-Be Workshop deck per domain using the Surface Type 3 (Workflow) and Surface Type 4 (Config) L3s as the process inventory. Each workflow L3 becomes a swim-lane step; each config L3 becomes an admin screen. The systematic L3s are excluded from the workshop and handed directly to implementation spec.

**L4 fill sequencing from here:**
1. **Week 1:** Spec systematic L4s for T, R, S, D from Counterpoint API docs (no UX needed — P1 in GRO-675)
2. **Week 2:** Run To-Be workshops for Q (LP investigator), J (receiving + buyer), N (store config) — highest-leverage UI surfaces
3. **Week 3+:** Spec UI L4s from To-Be workshop outputs; continue systematic fills for F, P, N
